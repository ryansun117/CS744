To run part2.py, execute run.sh in this directory

Note that we assume Hadoop and Spark exist in /mnt/data/hadoop-3.3.4/ and /mnt/data/spark-3.3.0-bin-hadoop3/, part2.py exist in /mnt/data/part2/part2.py, and export.csv exist in hdfs://10.10.1.1:9000/export.csv

It might be possible that when running part2.py and writing the output file to HDFS, you will encounter permission error. In this case, change the permission of HDFS by executing /mnt/data/hadoop-3.3.4/bin/hdfs dfs -chmod -R 777 /

List files in HDFS with /mnt/data/hadoop-3.3.4/bin/hdfs dfs -ls /
